This document records the performance baseline for BGUI components. These measurements serve as benchmarks for all future component implementations.

## Measurement Methodology

- **Tool**: react-native-performance (native) / Browser Performance API (web)
- **Sample Size**: 50 renders per component
- **Components Tested**: Box, Text, Stack, Divider, Container
- **Platform**: Both Web and Native
- **Measurement**: Time from component mount to paint completion

## How to Run Performance Tests

### Web Platform
1. Start Storybook: `pnpm storybook`
2. Navigate to "Tests/Performance Baseline"
3. Click "Run Performance Tests"
4. Copy the generated report

### Native Platform
1. Import `PerformanceBaseline` component in your app
2. Render it in a screen
3. Run the performance tests
4. Copy the generated report

## Baseline Results

### Web Platform Baseline
*To be populated after running tests*

```
# BGUI Component Performance Baseline (Web)

Generated on: [DATE]

## Component Render Times (in milliseconds)

| Component | Avg | Min | Max | Samples |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Box       | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Text      | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Stack     | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Divider   | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Container | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
```

### Native Platform Baseline
*To be populated after running tests on a target device*

```
# BGUI Component Performance Baseline (Native)

Generated on: [DATE]
Device: [DEVICE_MODEL]
OS: [OS_VERSION]

## Component Render Times (in milliseconds)

| Component | Avg | Min | Max | Samples |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Box       | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Text      | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Stack     | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Divider   | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
| Container | X.XX | X.XX | X.XX | 50     |
```

## Performance Targets

Based on the baseline measurements, future components should aim to meet these targets:

- **Simple Components** (like Divider): < 2ms average render time
- **Layout Components** (like Box, Stack, Container): < 5ms average render time  
- **Text Components**: < 3ms average render time
- **Complex Components** (future Tier 2-4): < 10ms average render time

## Re-establishing Baseline

The performance baseline should be re-established when:

1. Major React Native or React version upgrades
2. Significant changes to the theme system
3. Major refactoring of base components
4. Quarterly review (every 3 months)

## Notes

- Performance can vary significantly between devices
- Debug builds will have worse performance than release builds
- Initial render is typically slower than subsequent renders
- These measurements include style computation and layout calculation
