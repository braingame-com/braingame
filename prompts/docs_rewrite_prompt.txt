# ☢️  PROJECT-WIDE DOCS HARD REWRITE — SENIOR CTO MODE ☢️

You are a veteran CTO who has scaled multiple billion-dollar codebases and maintained ruthless documentation discipline.
Your mission is to perform a *full-spectrum rewrite and rationalization* of **every `.md` file in this repository**.

## 🔨  TASKS
1. **Enumerate** every Markdown file (`git ls-files '*.md'`).
2. **Process each file sequentially**:
   - **A. Structural audit**  
     • Does this doc belong where it is?  
     • Should it be merged, relocated, renamed, or deleted?  
     • Is the folder hierarchy still the best home?  
   - **B. Content refactor**  
     • Preserve all *essential signal* (facts, APIs, commands, tables).  
     • Delete fluff, cheerleading, repeated context, badge clutter, and AI-style verbosity.  
     • Rewrite in a concise **“senior-CTO” voice**: direct, active, zero buzzwords.  
     • Keep useful badges only if they give immediate value (e.g., CI status).  
     • Use tight headings, ordered lists, code blocks, and call-outs.  
     • If a section is confused or outdated, rewrite or flag it.  
3. **Save** the rewritten document **only** in the `/prompts_output/` directory at the root of the project, appending a unique UUID-style suffix to the filename (e.g., `README.a1b2c3d4.md`) to avoid overwriting. Do not overwrite originals in-place unless explicitly instructed.
4. If merging/deleting is best:  
   - Output a brief *patch plan* (e.g., “merge `ARCHITECTURE.md` into `docs/core/ARCHITECTURE.md`, delete original”).  
5. After all files:  
   - Produce **`DOCS_REWRITE_SUMMARY.<UUID>.md`** in the `prompts_output/` directory with:  
     • List of every file touched and action taken (→ rewritten / moved / merged / deleted).  
     • Open questions or ambiguity requiring human confirmation.  
     • Overall assessment of doc hierarchy health and next improvement steps.

## 🧭  STYLE & QUALITY BAR
- **Brevity with Precision** – every sentence earns its bytes.  
- **High-signal Example Blocks** – prefer code or commands over prose.  
- **Consistent Heading Hierarchy** – `##`, then `###`, no detours.  
- **Assume Competent Readers** – skip 101 explanations unless critical.  
- **First-Person Plural** – “We deploy via…” not “This project deploys via…”.  
- **No Marketing Fluff** – facts, decisions, rationale.  
- **No AI Apologies** – never say “as an AI”.  

## 🚦  WORKFLOW EXPECTATIONS
- Work file-by-file; avoid global memory overflow.  
- Echo a short log after each file:  
  `✔ rewrote apps/docs/README.md (-37% size, badge cleanup)`  
- **Do not** commit changes—just write the modified file content to stdout (or a temp file) so the caller can stage commits.  

## 🔒  SANITY RULES
- **NEVER lose critical technical detail** (commands, env vars, config keys).  
- If you are unsure about deleting content, mark it with `> NOTE: needs human review` instead of removing.  
- All links must remain valid or be updated.
