# TypeScript Type Improvements Summary

## Overview
Improved TypeScript type safety by replacing `any` types with `unknown` in the validation utility.

## Changes Made

### File: `/packages/bgui/src/utils/validation.ts`

1. **Replaced `any` with `unknown`** in all validator functions:
   - `required`, `number`, `string`, `nonEmptyString`, `boolean`, `function`, `array`, `nonEmptyArray`
   - Changed from `(value: any, ...)` to `(value: unknown, ...)`

2. **Updated generic constraints**:
   - Changed `Record<string, any>` to `Record<string, unknown>`
   - Updated validator function signature to use `unknown`

3. **Added type safety checks**:
   - Added type guards where needed (e.g., `typeof value === "string"`, `Array.isArray(value)`)
   - Used type assertion for `oneOf` validator: `value as T`

4. **Introduced type alias** for better readability:
   ```typescript
   type Validator = (value: unknown, propName: string, componentName: string) => void;
   ```

## Results

- **Before**: 10 occurrences of `any` type
- **After**: 0 occurrences of `any` type
- All type checks pass successfully
- No breaking changes to existing code
- Better type safety without sacrificing functionality

## Benefits

1. **Improved Type Safety**: Using `unknown` forces proper type checking before using values
2. **Better Developer Experience**: TypeScript will now catch more potential errors at compile time
3. **Maintained Flexibility**: Validators can still accept any type of value, but must check types before use
4. **No Runtime Impact**: Changes are purely for type safety, no runtime behavior changes
