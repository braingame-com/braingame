# CONSULTANT_FINDINGS_1-da881dff-6536-479b-b002-07eda19d6279.md

Verdict: **B+**

The repository demonstrates solid monorepo practices with extensive documentation and a clear cross-platform strategy. Tooling is modern (Turborepo, pnpm, Biome, Jest) and the architecture separates deployable apps from shared packages as described in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Architecture Coherence
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` outlines the single Turborepo approach and enforces that deployable apps depend on packages, not vice versa【F:docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md†L17-L29】【F:docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md†L38-L40】.
- Environment schemas in `packages/utils` provide strong typing for configuration across apps【F:packages/utils/env/schemas.ts†L1-L33】【F:packages/utils/env/schemas.ts†L120-L139】.
- Apps use shared configurations via `packages/config/tsconfig.base.json` and path aliases in `tsconfig.json`【F:tsconfig.json†L1-L19】【F:apps/product/tsconfig.json†L1-L11】.

## Code Quality
- Biome is configured as the linter/formatter with strict style rules【F:biome.json†L1-L28】.
- Pre-commit hooks enforce lint and typecheck passes, as mandated in `AGENTS.md`【F:docs/features/AGENTS.md†L42-L59】.
- Utilities are well typed; e.g. `useAsyncState` hook manages async operations with clear generics and error handling【F:packages/utils/hooks/useAsyncState.ts†L1-L39】.
- However, runtime log files (`expo-output.log`, `expo-server.log`, etc.) are committed to the repo, leaking local filesystem paths and cluttering history【F:apps/product/expo-output.log†L1-L10】【F:apps/product/expo-server.log†L1-L7】.

## Build & Tooling
- Turborepo tasks cover `lint`, `test`, `typecheck`, and production build pipelines【F:turbo.json†L3-L29】.
- Development commands and CI pipeline stages are clearly documented in `ARCHITECTURE.md`【F:docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md†L121-L158】.
- Attempting `pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` fails offline due to network access, indicating tooling relies on remote resources【955141†L1-L16】【bebb65†L1-L9】.

## Security Posture
- `.github/SECURITY.md` instructs contributors to never commit secrets and follow OWASP guidelines【F:.github/SECURITY.md†L50-L67】.
- `.secretlintrc.json` enforces secret scanning in pre-commit hooks【F:.secretlintrc.json†L1-L20】.
- Environment templates avoid shipping real credentials and stress secure secret management【F:apps/product/.env.example†L1-L33】【F:apps/api/.env.example†L1-L15】.
- No explicit secrets found in the repository, but log files could reveal environment paths.

## Scalability
- Backend API is a simple Express server with middleware for security (helmet, CORS) and logging【F:apps/api/src/index.ts†L1-L41】.
- Firebase is used for data persistence and email collection on the website with emulator support for local dev【F:apps/main-site/src/lib/firebase.ts†L1-L27】.
- No mention of horizontal scaling strategies, DB sharding, or advanced caching beyond TanStack Query in the app.

## Testing Strategy
- `docs/development/TESTING.md` documents a hybrid testing stack: Vitest for packages, Jest/Jest-Expo for the app, Storybook for visual tests, Playwright/Maestro for E2E【F:docs/development/TESTING.md†L20-L30】.
- TODO list highlights missing integration tests and visual regression coverage【F:TODO.md†L10-L19】.
- Packages include unit tests, but overall test coverage metrics are not reported.

## Documentation & Onboarding
- README links to detailed guides and stresses verifying workspace before running commands【F:README.md†L27-L60】.
- Architecture and quality standards are well documented, giving newcomers a clear path.
- Dates in docs follow the mandated `DD-MM-YYYY` style and appear up to date (e.g. 23-06-2025 in `CLAUDE.md`)【F:docs/features/CLAUDE.md†L1-L10】.

## Critical Fixes
1. **Remove committed log files** from `apps/product` and ensure logs are ignored.
2. **Adjust lint/typecheck tooling** to run without network access or document required connectivity.
3. **Implement integration and E2E tests** as listed in `TODO.md` to validate real user flows.
4. **Review security of environment handling** – ensure secrets are injected via CI and not stored locally.

## Quick Wins
- Add a top-level `docker-compose` for the API to simplify local onboarding.
- Include bundle size reporting in CI for both the Expo app and Next.js site.
- Consolidate duplicate documentation sections.
- Provide a script to bootstrap Firebase emulators for consistent dev experience.

## Roadmap for Elite Readiness
- Finalize the testing matrix and enforce coverage thresholds.
- Introduce production observability: metrics, alerting, and advanced performance monitoring.
- Plan for scaling the backend (serverless functions or container orchestration).
- Harden CI with offline-capable lint/typecheck steps and integrate dependency scanning.
- Document database schema and migration processes to support future features.

Overall, the project is well organized with strong documentation and modern tooling, but it needs cleanup of stray artifacts, a more robust CI setup, and completed test coverage to reach enterprise grade.
