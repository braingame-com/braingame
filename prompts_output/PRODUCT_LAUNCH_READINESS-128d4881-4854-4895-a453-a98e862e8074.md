Readiness Score: 6/10

## Core Value Delivery & Feature Coherence
- Unified mindset training platform across web and native apps with vision & goals, affirmations, visual inspiration, and performance tracking.
- BGUI component library enables consistent design across marketing site and product app.
- Advanced integrations (YouTube, analytics, Firebase) planned but not fully visible.
- Feature set appears comprehensive but may overwhelm first-time users.

## Critical User Journeys
- **Signup & Onboarding**: Firebase email collection is in progress; flow needs polish and error handling.
- **Paywall**: Pricing page and purchase flow not clearly documented; monetization model seems unfinished.
- **Core Task Execution**: Habit tracking and goal management flows are outlined but require real data persistence and offline support testing.

## Bloat & Distraction
- Marketing site includes numerous sections (testimonials, pricing, feature breakdown). Trim copy for launch to focus on core benefits.
- Mobile app has multiple feature tabs; consider staging less-critical features post-launch to reduce complexity.

## Revenue Hooks & Pricing Clarity
- Pricing page is marked as TODO; no clear subscription tiers or upsell path.
- In-app purchase mechanics and renewal reminders are not documented.
- Need consistent messaging about free vs paid features across all properties.

## Empty/Error States & Mobile Edge Cases
- Documentation highlights offline persistence and network error boundaries, but actual UI examples are sparse.
- Ensure graceful handling for missing data, failed network requests, and first-time user flows on both iOS and Android.

## Must-Fix Items Before Launch
- Finalize pricing strategy and integrate paywall across web and native apps.
- Complete signup flow with validation and error states.
- Audit all primary screens for empty state messaging and accessibility.
- Trim marketing content to emphasize immediate value and reduce clutter.
- Verify offline data persistence and sync reliability on mobile.
