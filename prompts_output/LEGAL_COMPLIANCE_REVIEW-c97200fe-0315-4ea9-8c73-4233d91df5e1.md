**Date:** 24-06-2025

## Issues
- MIT license present, but no explicit license field in `package.json`.
- Privacy policy provided, but no dedicated Terms of Service.
- Tracking via Sentry enabled; Mixpanel/Amplitude planned but commented out.
- Data collection statements cover GDPR and CCPA; COPPA briefly referenced.
- No attribution list for third‑party OSS licenses.

## Actions
- Add `license` field to `package.json` and ensure all subpackages declare MIT.
- Draft and publish comprehensive Terms of Service covering user responsibilities, acceptable use, and dispute resolution.
- Document telemetry providers (Sentry, potential analytics) in privacy policy and provide opt‑out controls.
- Confirm regional compliance steps for GDPR (DPIA, data processing agreement) and CCPA (data access/deletion requests).
- Generate a NOTICE file listing OSS licenses and required attributions.
