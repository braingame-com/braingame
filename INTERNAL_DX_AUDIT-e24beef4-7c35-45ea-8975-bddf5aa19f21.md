# Internal DX Audit - Brain Game

**Internal Friction Index:** 6/10

## Observations
- The repository includes extensive CLI scripts for component scaffolding and development utilities as described in `scripts/README.md`.
- Morgan is used for request logging and the API README explains how to start the service using `pnpm`.
- Firebase setup instructions outline how to deploy Firestore rules and run local emulators for testing.
- Firestore security rules restrict email signup documents to write-only access, blocking reads from client apps.
- The development guide details manual environment setup and dependency installation with `pnpm`.
- `TODO.md` sets a test coverage goal of **90%**, signalling a push to improve overall test completeness.

## Recommendations
- Improve CLI documentation for faster onboarding of new support engineers.
- Add redaction controls for sensitive data to enhance compliance.
- Expand audit logging and permission scopes for better observability.
- Increase automated test coverage and simplify setup scripts.

## Scaling Operations Plan
- Allocate headcount for a dedicated DevOps engineer to own CI/CD and internal tooling.
- Cross-train support staff on the admin panel and dashboard features to resolve issues without developer intervention.
- Schedule periodic DX reviews to track friction index improvements and adjust staffing as needed.
