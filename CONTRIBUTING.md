## üíª Contribution Workflow
To ensure a smooth process, please follow these steps:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  Follow the **[Development Guide](./docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)** to install prerequisites, dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

**Step 2: Plan Your Contribution**
1.  **Find an issue:** Check the **[TODO list](./docs/TODO.md)** for tasks that are marked as `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`.
2.  **Propose a change:** If you have a new idea, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. This prevents you from spending time on a change that might not be accepted.

**Step 3: Make Your Changes**
1.  **Create a feature branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b type/your-branch-name` (e.g., `feat/new-button-variant`).
2.  **Write your code.** Critically, all code must adhere to our **[Coding Style Guide](./docs/CODING_STYLE.md)**.
3.  **Write or update tests.** All new features must have corresponding tests.
4.  **Commit your work** using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. This is mandatory for our automated release process.

**Step 4: Submit Your Pull Request**
1.  **Run local checks:** Before pushing, ensure all checks pass locally: `pnpm lint && pnpm test`.
2.  **Push** your feature branch to your fork.
3.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the Brain Game repository.
4.  **Fill out the PR template.** Provide a clear title, a detailed description of your changes, and link to any relevant issues.
5.  **Wait for review.** A maintainer will review your PR, provide feedback, and guide you through the final steps to get it merged.
