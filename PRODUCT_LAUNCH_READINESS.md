# Product Launch Readiness Audit

**Date:** 24-06-2025

This audit covers the Brain Game monorepo at a high level. It evaluates the user experience, feature completeness and technical execution as we prepare for public launch.

## Score

**Product–Market Readiness:** **6/10**

The platform demonstrates strong technical ambition and a polished component library, but key flows are incomplete and the overall experience lacks cohesion. Significant work is needed before we can confidently push this live.

## Critical Issues

- **Onboarding gaps** – No clear first-run tutorial or guidance for new users. They land on a complex dashboard with minimal explanation.
- **Testing conflicts** – The repo contains both Jest and Vitest setups, leading to inconsistent coverage and failing CI commands. This must be resolved.
- **Firebase integration** – Email collection on the marketing site is unfinished, blocking lead generation.
- **App version management** – Versions are still hard-coded (`ErrorService.ts`) which risks user confusion when updates roll out.
- **Documentation bloat** – The docs are comprehensive, but the sheer volume is overwhelming. Core steps are buried under process detail.

## Areas to Improve or Cut

- **Simplify navigation** – The product app mixes tasks, mindset training and tracking features under a tabbed interface. It feels disjointed. Focus on one hero flow.
- **Reduce redundant pages** – The marketing and docs sites duplicate some content. Consolidate or cross-link to avoid scattering information.
- **Clarify data ownership** – The Google Sheets backend is fine for MVP, but users will worry about privacy. Make data handling transparent or upgrade storage.
- **Streamline error states** – Many components fail silently if API calls or local storage fail. Provide clear feedback and offline messaging.

## UX Goals for Next Phase

1. **Guide new users from install to first success** – Provide a short intro sequence that highlights goals, affirmations and progress tracking.
2. **Remove testing friction** – Pick one testing framework and achieve consistent coverage across packages. Lint and typecheck must pass locally and in CI.
3. **Polish failure handling** – Show friendly errors when network requests fail or the user is offline. Provide retry options.
4. **Unify design** – Ensure marketing, docs and product share the same tone and visuals so the platform feels like one product, not three projects.
5. **Prioritize mobile performance** – Optimize bundle size and run Lighthouse audits to ensure fast app load times.

## Features or Flows to Fix Before Launch

- Complete Firebase setup for email collection and analytics.
- Replace hard-coded version strings with build-time variables.
- Create `.env.example` files and validation to prevent missing configuration.
- Review each tab in the product app for clarity and remove any placeholder screens.
- Add at least basic unit tests for `packages/utils` to protect critical helpers.

## One-Sentence Pitch

“Brain Game is an ambitious all-in-one mindset trainer, but until onboarding, testing and data handling are nailed down, it’s more impressive code than a ready product.”
