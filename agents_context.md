# Agents Context - BGUI Component Improvements

## Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Issues (Completed)

### What was done:
1. **Removed all 'any' types**:
   - Fixed Accordion.tsx: Replaced `React.RefObject<any>` with `React.RefObject<View>`
   - Fixed List.tsx: Replaced `NativeSyntheticEvent<any>` with `NativeSyntheticEvent<{ key: string }>`
   - Fixed RadioGroup: Updated all Pressable type references to View

2. **Added error handling props** to all form components:
   - Added `error?: boolean`, `errorMessage?: string`, `helperText?: string` to:
     - Checkbox
     - RadioGroup
     - Select
     - Switch
     - Slider
   - Added `aria-invalid?: boolean` for accessibility

3. **Standardized prop naming**:
   - Changed Switch component from `value` to `checked` to match Checkbox
   - Both boolean state components now use consistent naming

4. **Added missing style props** for consistency:
   - Added `style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>` to Checkbox, Select, and Slider
   - Fixed TextInput to use `containerStyle` for the View wrapper

5. **Fixed import paths**:
   - Updated ProgressBar and RadioGroup to use correct @braingame/utils imports
   - Fixed React Native type imports

6. **Resolved TypeScript compilation errors**:
   - Fixed RadioGroup keyboard event handling (commented out unsupported onKeyDown)
   - Fixed TextInput style prop type mismatch
   - Fixed cloneElement type issues in RadioGroup

### Key decisions made:
- Chose to standardize on `checked` for boolean state props (not `value`)
- Added comprehensive error handling props to all form components
- Separated TextInput container style from input style for proper typing
- Commented out keyboard handlers that aren't supported in React Native

### Files modified:
- Accordion.tsx and types
- List.tsx  
- Checkbox types
- RadioGroup component and types
- Select types
- Switch component and types
- Slider component and types
- TextInput component and types
- ProgressBar imports
- Badge component (auto-fixed by linter)

All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the code passes linting.
