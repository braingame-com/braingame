# Brand Info/Guidelines - Brain Game

## Info
- We are the world's most effective personal development company.
- The main company email address is `hello@braingame.dev`.

## Naming
- Always refer to the company as **"Brain Game"** (with a space).
- If spaces are not allowed (e.g. usernames, subdomains), use all lowercase: **"braingame"**.
- Avoid casing variations like "BrainGame", "Braingame", or "brainGame" â€” these break brand clarity.
