First off, thank you for considering a contribution. Your time and effort are valued. This project thrives on community input, and we're excited to see what you bring to the table.

## üíª Contribution Workflow
To ensure a smooth process, please follow these steps:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  Follow the **[Development Guide](../docs/DEVELOPMENT.md)** to install prerequisites, dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

**Step 2: Plan Your Contribution**
1.  **Find an issue:** Check the **[TODO list](../docs/TODO.md)** for tasks that are marked as `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`.
2.  **Propose a change:** If you have a new idea, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. This prevents you from spending time on a change that might not be accepted.

**Step 3: Make Your Changes**
1.  **Create a feature branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b type/your-branch-name` (e.g., `feat/new-button-variant`).
2.  **Write your code.** Critically, all code must adhere to our **[Coding Style Guide](../docs/CODING_STYLE.md)**.
3.  **Write or update tests.** All new features must have corresponding tests.
4.  **Commit your work** using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. This is mandatory for our automated release process.

**Step 4: Submit Your Pull Request**
1.  **Run local checks:** Before pushing, ensure all checks pass locally: `pnpm lint && pnpm test`.
2.  **Push** your feature branch to your fork.
3.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the Brain Game repository.
4.  **Complete the PR template** with all required information.
5.  **Respond to feedback** from maintainers and make any requested changes.

## üìè Coding Standards

### Code Style
- **Language:** All code must be TypeScript.
- **Linting:** We use Biome for linting and formatting. Run `pnpm lint` before committing.
- **Components:** UI components go in `packages/bgui`. Follow the existing folder-per-component structure.
- **Utilities:** Shared helpers go in `packages/utils`.
- **Imports:** Use absolute imports for workspace packages (e.g., `@braingame/bgui`).

### Commit Messages
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that don't affect the meaning of code
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(bgui): add new Button variant for secondary actions
fix(product): resolve navigation crash on Android
docs: update README with new installation steps
```

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have tests
- Maintain or improve existing test coverage
- Run `pnpm test` to execute the test suite
- Tests should be colocated with the code they test
