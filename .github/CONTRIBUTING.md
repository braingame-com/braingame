# Contributing to Brain Game

First off, thank you for considering a contribution. Your time and effort are valued. This project thrives on community input, and we're excited to see what you bring to the table.

This document provides a high-level guide to our contribution process. For a deep dive into our technical standards and architecture, please consult the files in our [`docs`](../docs) folder.

## üíª Contribution Workflow
To ensure a smooth process, please follow these steps:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Environment**
1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine.
3.  Follow the **[Development Guide](../docs/handbook/development/DEVELOPMENT.md)** to install prerequisites, dependencies, and set up your environment variables.

**Step 2: Plan Your Contribution**
1.  **Find an issue:** Check the **[TODO list](../TODO.md)** for tasks that are marked as `help-wanted` or `good-first-issue`.
2.  **Propose a change:** If you have a new idea, we recommend opening an issue first to discuss it with the maintainers. This prevents you from spending time on a change that might not be accepted.

**Step 3: Make Your Changes**
1.  **Create a feature branch** from `main`: `git checkout -b type/your-branch-name` (e.g., `feat/new-button-variant`).
2.  **Write your code.** Critically, all code must adhere to our **[Coding Style Guide](../docs/handbook/development/CODING_STYLE.md)**.
3.  **Write or update tests.** All new features must have corresponding tests.
4.  **Commit your work** using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard. This is mandatory for our automated release process.

**Step 4: Submit Your Pull Request**
1.  **Run mandatory quality checks:** Before pushing, ALL of these must pass:
    ```bash
    pnpm lint      # Must be 0 errors, 0 warnings
    pnpm typecheck # Must be 0 errors  
    pnpm test      # All tests must pass
    ```
2.  **Push** your feature branch to your fork.
3.  **Open a Pull Request** against the `main` branch of the Brain Game repository.
4.  **Complete the quality checklist** (see Quality Standards section above).
5.  **Respond to feedback** from maintainers and make any requested changes.

## üìè Quality Standards (ZERO TOLERANCE)

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** We maintain a zero-tolerance policy for code quality issues. Every contribution must meet these standards before merge.

### Mandatory Quality Checks
Before submitting any PR, ALL of the following must pass:

- [ ] `pnpm lint` exits with **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck` exits with **0 errors**
- [ ] All pre-commit hooks pass without using `--no-verify`
- [ ] No `any` types in public APIs
- [ ] No `@ts-expect-error` or `biome-ignore` directives
- [ ] No technical debt introduction

### Banned Code Smells

| ‚ùå Banned Practice | Example | ‚úÖ Correct Approach |
|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| Double casting | `foo as unknown as Bar` | Create proper interface or generic |
| Hardcoded bin paths | `../../node_modules/.bin/tsc` | Use `pnpm exec tsc` |
| Blanket any types | `type Status = any` | Create minimal interface |
| Bypassing hooks | `git commit --no-verify` | Fix the underlying issue |
| Suppressing errors | `// @ts-expect-error` | Use proper TypeScript types |
| Deleting code to silence errors | Removing logic | Fix the type/lint issue |

### Emergency Override Procedures
Only **3 scenarios** allow bypassing quality checks (all require lead approval + ticket):

1. **Broken third-party release** with documented upstream issue
2. **Security hot-patch** during Sev-1 outage
3. **Repository bootstrapping** (first commit only)

**All other situations:** Fix the code to meet quality standards.

### Code Style
- **Language:** All code must be TypeScript.
- **Linting:** We use Biome for linting and formatting. Run `pnpm lint` before committing.
- **Components:** UI components go in `packages/bgui`. Follow the existing folder-per-component structure.
- **Utilities:** Shared helpers go in `packages/utils`.
- **Imports:** Use absolute imports for workspace packages (e.g., `@braingame/bgui`).
- **Universal Components:** BGUI components must work on all platforms (iOS, Android, Web) without platform-specific files (.web.tsx, .native.tsx). Use `Platform.select()` for platform differences.

### Commit Messages
We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:
- `feat:` New features
- `fix:` Bug fixes
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Changes that don't affect the meaning of code
- `refactor:` Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding or correcting tests
- `chore:` Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(bgui): add new Button variant for secondary actions
fix(product): resolve navigation crash on Android
docs: update README with new installation steps
```

### Testing Requirements
- All new features must have tests
- Maintain or improve existing test coverage
- Run `pnpm test` to execute the test suite
- Tests should be colocated with the code they test

## ü§ñ AI Agent Guidelines
If you're an AI agent contributing to this project:
1. **Read the documentation** in the `docs` folder, especially:
   - [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) for workspace verification and session documentation
   - [`CODING_STYLE.md`](../docs/handbook/development/CODING_STYLE.md) for code standards
2. **Update task tracking** in [`TODO.md`](../TODO.md) when claiming or completing tasks
3. **Add session summaries** to [`LESSONS.md`](../docs/handbook/knowledge/LESSONS.md) after completing work

---

## üé® Design Contributions
For UI/UX contributions:
- Use existing design tokens from `packages/utils`
- Ensure all components are accessible and support both light/dark themes

---

## üêõ Reporting Bugs
When reporting bugs, please include:
- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the behavior
- Expected behavior vs actual behavior
- Screenshots if applicable
- Your environment (OS, Node version, etc.)

---

## üí° Suggesting Features
We love new ideas! When suggesting features:
- Check if it's already in our [`TODO.md`](../TODO.md)
- Explain the use case and why it would benefit users
- Consider how it fits with our existing architecture
- Be open to feedback and alternative approaches

---

## üìñ Documentation
Good documentation is crucial. When contributing:
- Update relevant documentation for any code changes
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep the [`LESSONS.md`](../docs/handbook/knowledge/LESSONS.md) updated with session summaries if you're an AI agent
