# Project Audit - Brain Game

**Date:** 24-06-2025

## Repository Structure
- The project is organized as a Turborepo monorepo with shared packages and several apps (`api`, `docs-site`, `main-site`, `product`).
- Shared packages include a UI library (`bgui`), configuration utilities, internationalisation utilities, and a utilities package.
- Extensive documentation lives in the `docs` folder covering architecture, coding standards, worktree usage and the AI agent workflow.

## Documentation Quality
- Documentation is thorough and professional. Key guides like `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, and `QUALITY.md` establish strict quality and workflow standards.
- The project enforces zero-tolerance policies for linting and type safety. The docs emphasise workspace isolation and PR review procedures.
- `TODO.md` tracks outstanding tasks. High-priority items include resolving testing infrastructure conflicts and preparing for production deployment.

## Codebase Health
- Recent commits focus on documentation cleanup and refactoring app names for clarity.
- The codebase uses TypeScript across packages and apps, with Biome as the formatter/linter.
- Linting, typechecking and tests currently fail in this environment due to network restrictions, indicating CI may rely on external resources.

## Outstanding Risks
- Testing infrastructure is incomplete. Both Jest and Vitest configs exist in `packages/bgui`, causing conflicts as noted in `TODO.md`.
- Some production readiness tasks remain open, such as Firebase configuration and app store setup.
- The CI pipelines depend on network access for dependency resolution. In restricted environments, quality checks fail.

## Overall Progress
- The project exhibits solid architectural foundations and extensive documentation.
- Key focus areas moving forward are resolving testing conflicts, finalising environment configuration, and ensuring CI can run in offline or cached modes.
