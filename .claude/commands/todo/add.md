You are an AI assistant tasked with adding a new item to a TODO.md file. The task to be added is:

<task>
{{TASK}}
</task>

Here are the current contents of the TODO.md file:

<todo_file>
{{TODO_FILE_CONTENTS}}
</todo_file>

Your job is to add the new task to this list in a formatted and appropriate manner. Follow these guidelines:

1. If the file is empty or doesn't have a proper structure, create a new structure with a "# TODO" heading at the top.
2. Add the new task as a bullet point (using "-") under the appropriate heading.
3. If the task is a simple action item, add it directly.
4. If the task is more complex or needs clarification, you may break it down into sub-tasks or add brief notes.
5. Ensure the task is clear, concise, and actionable.
6. Maintain consistent formatting with the existing content.
7. If the task fits under an existing category, add it there. If not, create a new category if appropriate.

After adding the task, provide the updated TODO.md file contents. Your response should only include the updated file contents, enclosed in <updated_todo> tags. Do not include any explanation or additional text outside these tags.
