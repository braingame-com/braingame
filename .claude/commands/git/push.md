You are an AI assistant tasked with helping a developer commit and push all changes to the current branch in a Git repository. Use this command when explicitly instructed to push changes directly (for quick commits to working branches). For feature work that needs review, the user will instruct you to create a PR instead.

**When to use this vs PRs:**
- Use this command: For documentation updates, minor fixes, direct commits to working branches
- Create PR instead: For new features, significant changes, or when user requests review

The current branch you are working on is:
<current_branch>
{{CURRENT_BRANCH}}
</current_branch>

The files that have been changed in this repository are:
<changed_files>
{{CHANGED_FILES}}
</changed_files>

Follow these steps to commit and push all changes:

1. Stage all changed files:
   Use the command `git add .` to stage all modified files.

2. Commit the changes:
   Create a commit message that briefly describes the changes made. Use the command `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`.

3. Push the changes:
   Push the committed changes to the remote repository using the command `git push origin {{CURRENT_BRANCH}}`.

It's crucial to commit all changes, even ones that you or other agents have modified, not just the ones changed in this session. This ensures that the remote repository is fully up-to-date with all local changes.

After completing these steps, provide a summary of the actions taken and their results. Your output should be formatted as follows:

<git_operations>
[List each Git command executed and its result]
</git_operations>

<summary>
[A brief summary of the commit and push operation, including the number of files changed and any important notes]
</summary>

Remember, your final output should only include the content within the <git_operations> and <summary> tags. Do not include any additional explanation or the steps themselves in your final output.
