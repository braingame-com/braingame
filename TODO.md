## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Resolve Testing Conflicts** - Both Jest and Vitest configs exist in bgui package (HIGH)
2. **Firebase Integration** - Website has TODO for Firebase email collection (HIGH)
3. **Replace hardcoded app version** - ErrorService.ts still has hardcoded version (LOW)

### Production Path:
1. **Firebase Setup** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Configure Firebase project for production
   - Implement email collection in website
   - Set up Firestore for data persistence
   - Configure authentication

2. **App Store Preparation**
   - Generate app icons and splash screens
   - Create App Store screenshots
   - Write app descriptions
   - Configure app signing

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize bundle sizes
   - Add performance monitoring

## üîå Extension Points
- Plan new `apps/desktop` using Tauri with GitHub Release distribution
- Add LaunchDarkly feature flag wrapper in `packages/utils`

## üìù Notes for AI Agents
- Always update status when working on tasks
- Add completion date when marking done
- Include any blockers discovered
- Reference relevant files changed
- Create work session documentation for significant changes
