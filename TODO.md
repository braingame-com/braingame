## ðŸ”§ Technical Debt to Address

### Immediate Issues
- [ ] Fix Expo dev server issues (or switch to different approach)
- [ ] **Tech Debt:** Finish migrating BGUI tests/stories to the new theme provider and clean up temporary shims
- [ ] **Tech Debt:** Add light/dark regression coverage for BGUI components now that the theme engine is in-house
- [ ] **Tech Debt:** Reinstate failing pre-commit on test failures once Jest warnings are resolved

### Before Production
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Security audit (API keys, secrets)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility basics

---

## ðŸ§© Complexity Simplification
**Goal:** Boil the repo complexity down while keeping signal high and enterprise standards intact

<!-- - [ ] HIGH: Rebuild the documentation pipeline so `apps/docs-site` consumes a single `handbook/` source of truth (MDX + frontmatter), eliminating parallel navigation/config files -->
- [ ] HIGH: Replace scattered Node scripts with a typed `@braingame/cli` package that exposes subcommands (docs, workspace, components), deprecating ad-hoc JS entrypoints
- [ ] HIGH: Stand up an asset build system that generates all favicons, app icons, and illustrations from one manifest, wiring every app/package to consume outputs from `assets/dist`
