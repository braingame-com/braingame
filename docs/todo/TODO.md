# Brain Game - TODO

## üöÄ Roadmap to Revenue

### Phase 1: MVP BGUI & Landing Page
**Goal:** Get lead generation running ASAP

#### Fix BGUI Architecture Issue
- [ ] Fix dual platform implementation - components should be single .tsx files using React Native Web
- [ ] Current broken components that need fixing:
  - [ ] Button (has .native.tsx and .web.tsx - merge to single file)
  - [ ] Card (same issue)
  - [ ] Modal (same issue)
  - [ ] Input/TextInput (same issue)
  - [ ] All other split components

#### Build MVP BGUI Components
Just enough to build a landing page:
- [ ] Button (fixed single implementation)
- [ ] Card
- [ ] Text/Typography
- [ ] Input (email capture)
- [ ] Modal (GDPR/cookie consent)
- [ ] Container/Box
- [ ] Stack (layout)

#### Add Components to Docs Site
- [ ] Create component showcase pages
- [ ] Add interactive examples
- [ ] Verify they work on web

#### Build & Deploy Landing Page
- [ ] Simple hero section
- [ ] Email capture form
- [ ] Firebase integration (should already be partially set up)
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel/Firebase Hosting
- [ ] Set up domain

#### Start Lead Generation
- [ ] Run Google/Meta ads to landing page
- [ ] Collect emails
- [ ] Track conversion metrics

### Phase 3: MVP Product App
**Goal:** Ship the actual product

#### Core Features (from existing TODO)
- [ ] Onboarding flow (3 screens)
- [ ] Vision & Goals module (5 life areas)
- [ ] Daily Affirmations
- [ ] Visual Inspiration Gallery
- [ ] Basic Progress Tracking
- [ ] Settings & Profile

#### Platform Deployment

## üîß Technical Debt to Address

### Immediate Issues
- [ ] Fix Expo dev server issues (or switch to different approach)
- [ ] Clean up git history/branches
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies

### Before Production
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] Security audit (API keys, secrets)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Accessibility basics

## üìù Notes

### What We're NOT Doing Yet
- Enterprise features
- Complex analytics
- Multi-tenancy
- Advanced testing suites
- Extensive documentation
- Perfect code coverage
- Microservices architecture
- All the "consultant report" stuff

### Key Decisions
- Using React Native Web for universal components (no more dual implementations)
- Firebase for backend (simple, works, scalable enough)
- Focus on shipping fast, not perfect architecture
- Revenue first, optimization later
