# AI Context - Brain Game

> **Last Updated**: 20-06-2025
> A tactical dashboard for AI agents to maintain momentum and context.

---

## 1. Current Focus
1. ✅ Legacy migration from bg1 and dev-dil projects (ALL 4 WEEKS COMPLETE)
2. Production deployment preparation
3. Worktree management documentation and tooling
4. Performance baseline establishment

## ⚠️ Critical Workspace Information
**This repository uses git worktrees for isolation:**
- **Main worktree** (`braingame/`): Production work, final commits
- **Claude sandbox** (`braingame-claude-sandbox/`): AI development work
- **ALWAYS run `git worktree list` before starting work**
- **ALWAYS ask user which worktree to use if uncertain**

### 19-01-2025 - BGUI Testing Infrastructure Setup
- **Agent**: Claude (Opus 4)
- **Tasks**: Set up React Native Testing Library for BGUI components
- **Attempted**:
  - Installed testing dependencies: @testing-library/react-native, jest-expo, ts-jest, babel-jest
  - Created test infrastructure: jest.config.js, babel.config.js, jest-setup.js, test-utils.tsx
  - Wrote comprehensive Button.test.tsx with 14 test cases
  - Tried multiple Jest/Babel configurations to resolve compatibility issues
- **Blocker Encountered**: React Native 0.80.0 uses Flow type syntax which Jest cannot parse
  - Error: `type ErrorHandler = (error: mixed, isFatal: boolean) => void;`
  - Tried various approaches: different presets, transform patterns, mocking strategies
  - This is a known issue in the React Native ecosystem with newer versions
- **Documentation Created**:
  - TESTING.md: Comprehensive testing strategy and recommendations
  - work-sessions/2025-01-19-bgui-testing-setup.md: Detailed session notes
- **Recommendations**:
  - Use TypeScript for compile-time type safety
  - Consider Storybook for visual component testing
  - Test pure utility functions separately from React Native components
  - Wait for React Native Testing Library updates or use alternative testing strategies

### 19-06-2025 - Complete Lint and Type Error Resolution
- **Agent**: Claude (Opus 4)
- **Tasks**: Fix all Biome lint errors and TypeScript type errors across the entire monorepo

  - Created comprehensive work-sessions/2025-06-19-lint-and-type-fixes.md with detailed learnings
  - Improved pre-commit messaging for clear, actionable feedback
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Biome v2 doesn't support `ignore` in files section - use .biomeignore or modify lint scripts
  - React 18 vs 19 have different ReactNode types (bigint support)
  - Generated files (.expo, .next) need special handling to exclude from linting
  - Component APIs must be checked carefully - common prop naming mistakes
- **Next Steps**: All packages now pass linting and type checking

### 18-06-2025 - Code Smell Cleanup and Documentation Updates
- **Agent**: Claude (Opus 4)

  - Consolidated documentation structure (main README now references docs/README.md as documentation hub)
  - Updated all export paths in packages/bgui/index.ts
- **Key Decisions**:
  - .github/ is the canonical location for CONTRIBUTING.md and SECURITY.md
  - All BGUI components should be in src/components folder structure
  - docs/README.md serves as the documentation index
- **Next Steps**: Repository is now cleaner and more organized

## 4. Project Reference

### Known Constraints
- Basic CI/CD pipeline implemented (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Minimal Jest test suite (only utils package has tests)
- Turborepo configured via `turbo.json`
- Husky pre-commit hooks with secret scanning enabled

### Core Architecture Decisions
- Using **pnpm** workspaces (not npm/yarn)
- Using **Biome** for linting/formatting (not ESLint/Prettier)
- Using **Expo** for universal app (not separate React Native/web)
- Sharing UI components in `bgui` package

### File Locations
- **Apps**: `apps/product` (Expo), `apps/website` (Next.js)
- **Shared UI**: `packages/bgui`
- **Utils**: `packages/utils`
- **Config**: `packages/config`
- **Docs**: `docs/*`
