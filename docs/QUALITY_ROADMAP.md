# Quality Roadmap: Brain Game

> **This is our roadmap for achieving and maintaining world-class engineering standards.** It tracks our ongoing commitment to quality, scalability, and performance.

---

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Quality is a Feature:** We treat code quality, test coverage, and developer experience as first-class features of our product.
- **Continuous Improvement:** This roadmap is a living document. We are always looking for opportunities to improve our tools, processes, and standards.
- **Data-Driven Decisions:** We use metrics (test coverage, performance benchmarks, etc.) to guide our quality initiatives.
