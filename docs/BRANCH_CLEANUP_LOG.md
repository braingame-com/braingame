### Cleanup Script
Created `scripts/cleanup-branches.sh` that:
1. Fetches all open PRs
2. Identifies merged branches
3. Cross-references to find safe deletions
4. Provides interactive confirmation
5. Deletes remote branches
6. Prunes local tracking branches

### Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Delete branches after PR merge** - Don't let them accumulate
2. **Use branch protection** - Auto-delete head branches on merge
3. **Regular cleanup** - Run cleanup script monthly
4. **Name branches clearly** - Use prefixes like feat/, fix/, chore/
5. **Document important branches** - If a branch needs to be kept, document why
