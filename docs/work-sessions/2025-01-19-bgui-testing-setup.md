# Work Session: BGUI Testing Infrastructure Setup

**Date**: 19-01-2025
**Duration**: Extended session  
**Focus**: Setting up React Native Testing Library for BGUI components

## Summary

Attempted to set up comprehensive testing infrastructure for the BGUI React Native component library. Encountered significant challenges with React Native 0.80.0's Flow type syntax and Jest compatibility.

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Installed Testing Dependencies**:
   - `@testing-library/react-native`: For React Native component testing
   - `@testing-library/jest-native`: For additional Jest matchers
   - `jest-expo`: Expo's Jest preset
   - `ts-jest`: TypeScript support
   - `babel-jest`: Babel transformation
   - Various Babel presets for React Native compatibility

2. **Created Test Infrastructure**:
   - `jest.config.js`: Multiple iterations trying different configurations
   - `babel.config.js`: Various preset combinations
   - `jest-setup.js`: Global test setup
   - `test-utils.tsx`: Custom render function with providers
   - `__mocks__/fileMock.js`: Mock for static assets

3. **Wrote Comprehensive Button Tests**:
   - Created `Button.test.tsx` with 14 test cases covering:
     - Basic rendering
     - User interactions
     - Disabled states
     - Icon positioning
     - Loading states
     - Variants and sizes
     - Accessibility features
     - Full width mode

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created `TESTING.md` documenting challenges and recommendations
   - Updated work session tracking

## Challenges Encountered

### 1. Flow Type Syntax Errors
React Native 0.80.0 uses Flow for type annotations, which Jest cannot parse:
```
type ErrorHandler = (error: mixed, isFatal: boolean) => void;
SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'ErrorHandler'
```

### 2. Module Resolution Issues
- Complex monorepo structure made cross-package imports difficult
- Asset imports (fonts) required additional mocking
- React Native module imports caused circular dependencies

### 3. Babel Configuration Complexity
- Conflicting babel presets between Metro and Jest
- Private class methods requiring specific plugins
- Different transform requirements for JS vs TS files

### 4. Version Compatibility
- React Native Testing Library expecting different React Native version
- Jest 30 vs Jest 29 peer dependency conflicts
- React 18 vs React 19 type compatibility issues

## Key Learnings

1. **React Native Testing is Complex**: The combination of Flow types, Metro bundler, and Jest creates compatibility challenges

2. **Monorepo Adds Complexity**: Cross-package dependencies and shared configurations make testing setup more difficult

3. **Version Alignment Critical**: Ensuring all testing libraries, React Native, and React versions are compatible is crucial

4. **Alternative Approaches Needed**: Given the complexity, consider:
   - Unit testing pure functions separately
   - Visual testing with Storybook
   - E2E testing with Detox
   - Manual testing in Expo

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Prioritize TypeScript**: Use TypeScript's compile-time checking as the first line of defense

2. **Start Simple**: Begin with testing pure utility functions that don't import React Native

3. **Component Testing Strategy**:
   - Use Storybook for visual documentation and testing
   - Manual testing in Expo development environment
   - Consider snapshot testing once basic setup works

4. **Future Investigation**:
   - Research React Native New Architecture testing approaches
   - Look into Expo's testing recommendations
   - Consider upgrading to React Native Testing Library v13+

## Files Modified

- `/packages/bgui/package.json`: Added testing dependencies
- `/packages/bgui/jest.config.js`: Created and iterated multiple times
- `/packages/bgui/babel.config.js`: Created with various preset combinations
- `/packages/bgui/jest-setup.js`: Global test setup
- `/packages/bgui/src/test-utils.tsx`: Testing utilities
- `/packages/bgui/src/components/Button/Button.test.tsx`: Comprehensive test suite
- `/packages/bgui/TESTING.md`: Testing documentation

## Conclusion

While we successfully wrote comprehensive tests and set up the testing infrastructure, the execution was blocked by React Native's Flow syntax incompatibility with Jest. This is a known challenge in the React Native ecosystem, especially with newer versions.

The work done provides a solid foundation for when the compatibility issues are resolved or alternative testing strategies are implemented. The test cases written for the Button component can serve as templates for testing other components once the infrastructure is working.
