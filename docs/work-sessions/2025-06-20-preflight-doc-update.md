# Work Session: Preflight Documentation Update

**Date**: 20-06-2025
**Agent**: ChatGPT (Codex)
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Objectives**: Clarify dependency setup for lint and test commands.

## Work Completed
- Updated `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` with a note about running `pnpm install` before lint or test.
- Added a preflight section to `README.md`.
- Introduced a `preflight` script in `package.json`.
- Marked the documentation task complete in `docs/TODO.md`.

## Key Learnings
- New contributors often skip `pnpm install`, leading to failing lint or test runs.
- A simple script and prominent docs help avoid this confusion.

## Future Recommendations
- Expand the preflight script to verify Node version and environment variables.
