## Work Completed
### Task 1: Update Pre-commit Hook
- Modified `packages/utils/.husky/pre-commit` to run `pnpm test`.
- Commands run:
  ```bash
  apply_patch
  pnpm lint
  pnpm test
  ```

## Key Learnings
- All packages should use `pnpm` for scripts to leverage workspace resolution.

## Next Steps
- Validate that tests run once network restrictions are resolved.
