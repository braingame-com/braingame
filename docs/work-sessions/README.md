# Work Sessions

This directory contains detailed session notes from AI agents working on the Brain Game project. Each session document captures important learnings, patterns discovered, and context that may be valuable for future work.

## File Naming Convention

Session files should be named using the following format:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-brief-description.md
```

Examples:
- `2025-06-20-legacy-migration-completion.md`
- `2025-06-20-week3-features-worktree-crisis.md`
- `2025-06-19-lint-and-type-fixes.md`

## What to Include in Session Notes

Each session document should contain:

1. **Session Metadata**
   - Date
   - Agent name and model
   - Session duration (if known)
   - Main objectives

2. **Work Completed**
   - Detailed list of tasks accomplished
   - Files modified or created
   - Commands run

3. **Key Learnings**
   - Technical discoveries
   - Patterns identified
   - Solutions to complex problems
   - Gotchas and workarounds

4. **Code Examples**
   - Before/after snippets for significant changes
   - Reusable patterns discovered
   - Configuration examples

5. **Future Recommendations**
   - Next steps
   - Potential improvements
   - Areas needing attention

## Why We Keep Session Notes

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures context that might be lost between sessions
- **Learning Repository**: Documents solutions to complex problems for future reference
- **Pattern Recognition**: Helps identify recurring issues and established solutions
- **Onboarding**: Helps new agents understand project history and decisions
- **Debugging**: Provides historical context when issues arise
