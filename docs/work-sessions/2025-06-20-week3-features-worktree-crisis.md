# Work Session: Week 3 Advanced Features Implementation & Worktree Crisis Resolution

## Session Metadata
- **Date**: 20-06-2025  
- **Agent**: Claude (Sonnet 4)
- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Objectives**: 
  1. Continue Week 3 advanced features implementation (navigation patterns)
  2. **EMERGENCY**: Resolve worktree contamination crisis
  3. Implement prevention measures to ensure this never happens again

## ðŸš¨ Critical Incident Summary

### What Went Wrong
**MAJOR INCIDENT**: Agent started working in main production `braingame/` repo instead of `braingame-claude-sandbox/`, mixing Week 3 experimental features with user's production testing migration work.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Documentation Gap (40%)**: No worktree setup documented in any agent guidance docs
2. **Process Violation (60%)**: Agent completely ignored existing CLAUDE.md workflow requirements
   - Skipped Phase 1: Setup & Pre-flight entirely
   - Never read ARCHITECTURE.md or AI_CONTEXT.md as required
   - Never checked TODO.md or established task context
   - Jumped straight to coding without orientation

### Impact Assessment
- **Contaminated** main production repo with experimental Week 3 features
- **Mixed** user's testing migration work (TESTING.md, vitest configs) with navigation patterns
- **Required emergency surgical git separation** to preserve both work streams
- **Lost development time** on crisis resolution instead of feature implementation

### Resolution Strategy
**Phase 1: Immediate Damage Control**
1. **Preserved user's testing work**: Stashed to temporary backup
2. **Isolated Week 3 features**: Removed from staged changes selectively
3. **Clean commit**: Committed pure Week 3 features to `week3-advanced-features` branch
4. **Restored user work**: Applied testing files back to main branch

**Phase 2: Worktree Realignment**  
1. **Cleaned claude-sandbox**: Resolved stash conflicts, committed mindset work properly
2. **Established proper workspace**: Verified claude-sandbox on week3 branch
3. **Verified isolation**: Both repos now have clean separation

**Phase 3: Prevention Implementation**
1. **Updated all agent docs** with worktree requirements
2. **Enhanced CLAUDE.md** with mandatory workspace verification
3. **Added AGENTS.md guardrails** for all AI agents
4. **Updated ARCHITECTURE.md** with worktree documentation

### Task 4: Prevention Documentation
**Files Updated**:
- `docs/CLAUDE.md` - Added mandatory workspace verification to Phase 1
- `docs/AGENTS.md` - Added workspace isolation as core principle
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Added Development Worktrees section
- `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md` - Added critical workspace information section

## Key Learnings

### 1. Worktree Isolation is Critical
**Issue**: No documentation existed about the git worktree setup and its purpose

**Solution**: Comprehensive documentation added to all agent guidance files

**Prevention Measures**:
```markdown
# Now required in CLAUDE.md Phase 1:
1. **Workspace Check:** ALWAYS run `git worktree list` and confirm location
2. **Location Verification:** Run `pwd && git branch --show-current`  
3. If uncertain which to use, STOP and ask the user
```

### 2. Process Adherence Prevents Chaos
**Issue**: Agent skipped CLAUDE.md Golden Path Workflow entirely

**Root Cause**: Treated continuation as "resume coding" instead of "start new session"

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced documentation emphasizes this applies to ALL sessions
- Added explicit workspace verification as first step
- Made uncertainty handling mandatory (STOP and ask)

**Example Prevention Protocol**:
```bash
# MANDATORY session startup checklist:
git worktree list              # See available workspaces
pwd && git branch --show-current  # Confirm current location
# If unsure â†’ STOP and ask user
```

### 3. Git Surgery is Possible But Painful
**Issue**: Mixed work streams required complex separation

**Solution Approach**:
1. **Temporary backup** of user work to safe location
2. **Selective unstaging** to separate work streams  
3. **Clean commits** of separated work
4. **Restoration** of user work to correct location

**Prevention**: Much easier to verify workspace BEFORE starting work

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Mixed Staged Changes
- **Context**: User's testing work and Week 3 features were both staged
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. `git reset --soft` - Too broad, lost specificity
  2. `git reset HEAD specific-files` - âœ… Worked for surgical separation
- **Final Solution**: File-by-file unstaging to preserve both work streams

### Challenge: Worktree Branch Conflicts  
- **Context**: claude-sandbox had mindset changes conflicting with week3 branch
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  1. Force checkout - Would lose work
  2. Stash â†’ checkout â†’ pop - âœ… Worked but required conflict resolution
- **Final Solution**: Stash, checkout, resolve conflicts, commit properly

### Challenge: Documentation Gaps
- **Context**: No existing docs mentioned worktree setup
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive worktree documentation to 4 key files:
  1. `CLAUDE.md` - Mandatory workspace verification
  2. `AGENTS.md` - Core principle for all agents  
  3. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical worktree explanation
  4. `AI_CONTEXT.md` - Critical workspace information

## Tools and Commands

### Git Worktree Management
```bash
# List all worktrees and their branches
git worktree list

# Check current location and branch
pwd && git branch --show-current

# Work with remote worktree
git -C /path/to/worktree <command>
```

### Surgical Git Operations
```bash
# Selective file unstaging
git reset HEAD file1.ts file2.ts

# Backup files to temp location
cp important-files /tmp/backup/

# Cross-worktree operations
git -C other-worktree stash push -m "description"
git -C other-worktree checkout branch-name
```

### File Separation Strategy
```bash
# 1. Backup user files
mkdir -p /tmp/testing-backup
cp user-files /tmp/testing-backup/

# 2. Remove from staging selectively  
git reset HEAD user-file1 user-file2

# 3. Commit clean changes
git commit -m "clean commit message"

# 4. Restore user files
cp /tmp/testing-backup/* original-locations/
```

## Patterns and Best Practices

### Pattern: Mandatory Session Startup Protocol
- **When to use**: Every single agent session, no exceptions
- **Implementation**:
  ```bash
  # Phase 0: Workspace Verification (MANDATORY)
  git worktree list
  pwd && git branch --show-current
  # Confirm with user if ANY uncertainty
  
  # Phase 1: CLAUDE.md workflow
  # Read docs, check TODO.md, etc.
  ```
- **Benefits**: Prevents workspace contamination, ensures proper context

### Pattern: Defensive Documentation
- **When to use**: When documenting requirements for autonomous agents
- **Implementation**: Add the same critical information to multiple docs
  - CLAUDE.md: Specific to Claude
  - AGENTS.md: Universal for all agents  
  - ARCHITECTURE.md: Technical foundation
  - AI_CONTEXT.md: Session-to-session continuity
- **Benefits**: Redundancy ensures no agent misses critical requirements

### Pattern: Git Surgery Protocol
- **When to use**: When work streams get mixed accidentally
- **Implementation**:
  1. **STOP** - Don't make the situation worse
  2. **Backup** - Preserve all work before attempting separation
  3. **Separate** - Use selective git operations to isolate work streams
  4. **Verify** - Confirm both work streams are intact
  5. **Document** - Record what went wrong and how to prevent it
- **Benefits**: Recoverable from complex git situations without data loss

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Enforce Workspace Verification**: Consider adding a git hook or script that forces workspace confirmation for all agents

2. **Enhanced Session Startup**: Consider a mandatory pre-flight checklist script that agents must run

3. **Worktree Documentation**: Consider adding a dedicated `docs/WORKTREES.md` with detailed setup and usage instructions

4. **Agent Training**: Ensure all future agents (not just Claude) are trained on the worktree protocol

5. **Monitoring**: Consider adding logging to track which worktree agents are working in

## Next Steps

- [ ] Continue advanced navigation patterns implementation in claude-sandbox
- [ ] Complete Week 3 features roadmap
- [ ] Consider implementing pre-flight verification scripts
- [ ] Monitor for any other documentation gaps that could cause similar issues
