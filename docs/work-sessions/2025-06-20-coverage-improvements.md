# Work Session: Coverage Improvements

**Date**: 20-06-2025
**Agent**: ChatGPT
**Objectives**: Add missing tests for PageWrapper and View components and update coverage reporting

## Work Completed
- Created `PageWrapper.test.tsx` and `View.test.tsx`
- Updated `jest.config.js` to include root components for testing
- Attempted to run tests with coverage but React Native dependencies caused failures
- Updated `docs/TODO.md`, `docs/AI_CONTEXT.md`, and `docs/TEST_COVERAGE_REPORT.md`

## Key Learnings
- Jest requires explicit roots to locate tests outside the `src` directory
- React Native modules still cause Flow parsing errors despite Babel presets

## Future Recommendations
- Investigate custom transforms or mocks for React Native modules to enable full coverage
