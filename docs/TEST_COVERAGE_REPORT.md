# Test Coverage Report

> **Last Updated:** 20-06-2025

The `packages/bgui` package now includes unit tests for most components. However, running `pnpm test --filter @braingame/bgui -- --coverage` currently fails due to environment issues, so coverage numbers are unavailable.

## Components With Tests

- Accordion
- ActionList
- Avatar
- Badge
- Button
- Card
- Checkbox
- Divider
- ErrorBoundary
- Icon
- Image
- Label
- Link
- Menu
- Modal
- ProgressBar
- RadioGroup
- Select
- Slider
- Spinner
- Switch
- Tabs
- Text
- Toast
- Tooltip

_Coverage generation will resume once the test environment is fully operational._
