## üîÑ Migration Process Workflow

**For AI Agents working on migration tasks:**

### Branch & PR Strategy:
The migration epic is organized into **separate branches and PRs** for better context and incremental merging:

```bash
# Weekly migration branches (from main)
feature/migration-week1-typography-lexend     # Typography & Design Tokens
feature/migration-week2-mindset-training      # Core Mindset Training Features  
feature/migration-week3-advanced-features     # Advanced Features & Content
feature/migration-week4-enhancement-polish    # Enhancement & Polish
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Focused code review** - Each PR has clear scope and context
- ‚úÖ **Incremental merging** - Can merge Week 1 while working on Week 2
- ‚úÖ **Better git history** - Clean separation of different migration phases
- ‚úÖ **Easier rollback** - Can revert specific weeks if needed
- ‚úÖ **Parallel work** - Human can review/test while AI continues next phase

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **üå≥ Branch** - Create weekly feature branch from main for focused scope
2. **üìã Analyze** - Examine both legacy projects for the specific week's tasks
3. **üí≠ Propose** - Present detailed approach and ask human for approval
4. **‚ö° Execute** - Only proceed after explicit human approval
5. **üìù Document** - Create migration log in `/docs/legacy-migration/logs/`
6. **üëÄ Review** - Ask human to review completed work
7. **üíæ Commit** - Only commit after human approval with clear message
8. **üîÄ PR** - Create focused PR for the week's work, get approval, merge
9. **‚û°Ô∏è Next** - Move to next week's branch and repeat

### Migration Log Format:
Each task should create a numbered log file: `001-task-name.md`

**Required sections:**
- **Task Summary** - What was migrated
- **Source Analysis** - What was found in legacy projects
- **Implementation Details** - How it was integrated
- **Key Decisions** - Important choices made during migration
- **Learnings & Notes** - Insights for future agents
- **Files Changed** - List of modified/created files

### Important Notes:
- **Font Strategy:** Using Lexend (from dev-dil) instead of TestS√∂hne (from bg1)
- **Icon Strategy:** Using FontAwesome Free with Pro upgrade path (comment out Pro features)
- **No work-session logs needed** - Migration logs replace them for this epic
- **Always ask for approval** before making changes

### üß† **Critical Migration Philosophy:**

**PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY, IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION** - bg1 represents earlier engineering work and may not follow current best practices. Always think critically about what we're migrating:

- ‚úÖ **Extract the value** (functionality, patterns, content)
- ‚ùå **Don't blindly copy** implementation details
- üéØ **Improve where possible** - make code cleaner, more maintainable, more enterprise-grade
- ü§î **Question everything** - just because it exists doesn't mean it's optimal

**Example:** Instead of migrating separate `DisplayTitle`, `Title`, `Heading` components from bg1, create a single `Text` component with `variant` props for better maintainability.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this follow current best practices?
- Can we achieve the same functionality more cleanly?
- Does this fit our current architecture patterns?
- Would this pass enterprise code review standards?

## üéØ Migration Overview

This document outlines the strategic migration of two legacy projects into the current braingame ecosystem. The goal is to preserve months of development work while maintaining the architectural integrity of the current project.

### Source Projects

#### 1. **bg1** (`/Users/jordancrow-stewart/Desktop/code/bg1`)
- **Description:** Previous iteration of braingame before adopting Expo Router
- **Status:** Legacy codebase with significant development investment
- **Key Assets to Evaluate:**
  - UI Components and component library
  - Styling systems and design tokens
  - Icon collections and assets
  - Project setup and configuration
  - Screen implementations and layouts
  - Business logic and utilities

#### 2. **dev-dil** (`/Users/jordancrow-stewart/Desktop/code/dev-dil`)
- **Description:** Personal productivity React app for mindset training
- **Status:** Actively used daily by project owner
- **Key Assets to Evaluate:**
  - Core feature implementations (mindset training functionality)
  - Content and data structures
  - User experience patterns
  - Working business logic
  - Proven user interface components

---

## üöÄ Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Discovery & Assessment
**Objective:** Understand what exists in each legacy project

1. **Inventory Assets**
   - Catalog all components, screens, and features in both projects
   - Identify unique functionality not present in current braingame
   - Document styling approaches and design systems
   - List reusable utilities and business logic

2. **Conflict Analysis**
   - Compare component implementations across all three projects
   - Identify naming conflicts and architectural differences
   - Document styling system differences
   - Map equivalent functionality between projects

3. **Value Assessment**
   - Rank assets by reusability and business value
   - Identify "quick wins" vs complex migrations
   - Document current braingame gaps that legacy projects could fill

### Phase 2: Strategic Planning
**Objective:** Create detailed migration roadmap

1. **Asset Categorization**
   - **High Priority:** Daily-use dev-dil features, proven UX patterns
   - **Medium Priority:** Unique bg1 components, styling enhancements
   - **Low Priority:** Duplicate functionality, outdated patterns

2. **Integration Approach**
   - **Direct Migration:** Assets that fit cleanly into current architecture
   - **Adaptation Required:** Assets that need modification for current patterns
   - **Inspiration Only:** Complex assets to be reimplemented using current standards

3. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Where to place migrated components in current BGUI structure
   - How to handle conflicting styling systems
   - Integration with current theming and token system
   - Handling of different state management approaches

### Phase 3: Incremental Migration
**Objective:** Execute migration in manageable chunks

1. **Foundation Assets** (Week 1)
   - Migrate core utilities and helpers
   - Integrate compatible styling tokens
   - Port over icon collections and static assets

2. **Component Library** (Week 2-3)
   - Migrate unique UI components not present in current BGUI
   - Adapt existing components with better implementations
   - Integrate enhanced styling patterns

3. **Feature Implementation** (Week 3-4)
   - Port core dev-dil mindset training features
   - Migrate proven screen layouts and UX patterns
   - Integrate business logic and data structures

4. **Content & Configuration** (Week 4)
   - Transfer content, copy, and data
   - Migrate useful configuration patterns
   - Port development tooling and setup improvements

- No conflicts with existing functionality
- Clear improvement over current implementation
- Low migration complexity

### When to Adapt
- Core functionality valuable but implementation conflicts
- Styling/architectural differences require modification
- Can be enhanced to fit current patterns
- Medium migration complexity

### When to Reimplement
- Significant architectural conflicts
- Better to rebuild using current standards
- Complex dependencies or legacy patterns
- Use as inspiration for new implementation

### When to Skip
