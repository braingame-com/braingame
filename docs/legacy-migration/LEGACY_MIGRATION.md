## üîÑ Migration Process Workflow

**For AI Agents working on migration tasks:**

### Branch & PR Strategy:
The migration epic is organized into **separate branches and PRs** for better context and incremental merging:

```bash
# Weekly migration branches (from main)
feature/migration-week1-typography-lexend     # Typography & Design Tokens
feature/migration-week2-mindset-training      # Core Mindset Training Features  
feature/migration-week3-advanced-features     # Advanced Features & Content
feature/migration-week4-enhancement-polish    # Enhancement & Polish
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Focused code review** - Each PR has clear scope and context
- ‚úÖ **Incremental merging** - Can merge Week 1 while working on Week 2
- ‚úÖ **Better git history** - Clean separation of different migration phases
- ‚úÖ **Easier rollback** - Can revert specific weeks if needed
- ‚úÖ **Parallel work** - Human can review/test while AI continues next phase

### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **üå≥ Branch** - Create weekly feature branch from main for focused scope
2. **üìã Analyze** - Examine both legacy projects for the specific week's tasks
3. **üí≠ Propose** - Present detailed approach and ask human for approval
4. **‚ö° Execute** - Only proceed after explicit human approval
5. **üìù Document** - Create migration log in `/docs/legacy-migration/logs/`
6. **üëÄ Review** - Ask human to review completed work
7. **üíæ Commit** - Only commit after human approval with clear message
8. **üîÄ PR** - Create focused PR for the week's work, get approval, merge
9. **‚û°Ô∏è Next** - Move to next week's branch and repeat

### Migration Log Format:
Each task should create a numbered log file: `001-task-name.md`

**Required sections:**
- **Task Summary** - What was migrated
- **Source Analysis** - What was found in legacy projects
- **Implementation Details** - How it was integrated
- **Key Decisions** - Important choices made during migration
- **Learnings & Notes** - Insights for future agents
- **Files Changed** - List of modified/created files

### Important Notes:
- **Font Strategy:** Using Lexend (from dev-dil) instead of TestS√∂hne (from bg1)
- **Icon Strategy:** Using FontAwesome Free with Pro upgrade path (comment out Pro features)
- **No work-session logs needed** - Migration logs replace them for this epic
- **Always ask for approval** before making changes

### üß† **Critical Migration Philosophy:**

**PRESERVE FUNCTIONALITY, IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION** - bg1 represents earlier engineering work and may not follow current best practices. Always think critically about what we're migrating:

- ‚úÖ **Extract the value** (functionality, patterns, content)
- ‚ùå **Don't blindly copy** implementation details
- üéØ **Improve where possible** - make code cleaner, more maintainable, more enterprise-grade
- ü§î **Question everything** - just because it exists doesn't mean it's optimal

**Example:** Instead of migrating separate `DisplayTitle`, `Title`, `Heading` components from bg1, create a single `Text` component with `variant` props for better maintainability.

**Guiding Questions:**
- Does this follow current best practices?
- Can we achieve the same functionality more cleanly?
- Does this fit our current architecture patterns?
- Would this pass enterprise code review standards?

   - **Direct Migration:** Assets that fit cleanly into current architecture
   - **Adaptation Required:** Assets that need modification for current patterns
   - **Inspiration Only:** Complex assets to be reimplemented using current standards

3. **Architecture Decisions**
   - Where to place migrated components in current BGUI structure
   - How to handle conflicting styling systems
   - Integration with current theming and token system
   - Handling of different state management approaches

### Phase 3: Incremental Migration
**Objective:** Execute migration in manageable chunks

1. **Foundation Assets** (Week 1)
   - Migrate core utilities and helpers
   - Integrate compatible styling tokens
   - Port over icon collections and static assets

2. **Component Library** (Week 2-3)
   - Migrate unique UI components not present in current BGUI
   - Adapt existing components with better implementations
   - Integrate enhanced styling patterns

3. **Feature Implementation** (Week 3-4)
   - Port core dev-dil mindset training features
   - Migrate proven screen layouts and UX patterns
   - Integrate business logic and data structures

4. **Content & Configuration** (Week 4)
   - Transfer content, copy, and data
   - Migrate useful configuration patterns
