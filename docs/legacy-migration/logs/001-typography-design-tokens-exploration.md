# Migration Log 001: Typography & Design Tokens Exploration

**Date:** 2025-01-20  
**Task:** Explore bg1 and dev-dil typography systems for migration planning  
**Status:** Completed  

---

## Task Summary

Comprehensive exploration of typography and design token systems in both legacy projects to understand what assets are available for migration to the current braingame monorepo.

**Source Projects:** bg1 (TestSöhne typography system) + dev-dil (Lexend implementation)  
**Target:** Foundation for Week 1 typography migration  

---

## Source Analysis

### BG1 Typography System (`/Users/jordancrow-stewart/Desktop/code/bg1`)

**Typography Components** (`design/typography.tsx`):
- 9 semantic components: DisplayTitle, Title, Heading, Subtitle, Bold, Text, SecondaryText, Small, SmallThin
- Consistent API with `mono` prop for monospace variants
- Theme integration with React Navigation

**Design Tokens** (`setup/styles.ts`):
```typescript
// Spacing tokens (xxxs to xxxl)
xxxs: 2, xxs: 4, xs: 8, s: 12, ms: 16, m: 16, l: 20, xl: 24, xxl: 32, xxxl: 40

// Color system
Basic: white, grey, greyFaded, black
Informative: primary, positive, warn, negative (with faded variants)
Artistic: tabPurple, tabGreen, tabOrange, tabBlue, tabYellow (with faded variants)
```

**TestSöhne Font Setup** (`App.tsx`):
- 8 font variants loaded via Expo's `useFonts`
- Regular + Mono families with 4 weights each
- Complete font asset collection (31 files total)

### DEV-DIL Lexend Implementation (`/Users/jordancrow-stewart/Desktop/code/dev-dil`)

**Lexend Font Setup** (`src/App.css`):
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Lexend";
  src: url("./setup/Lexend-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 100 900;  // Variable font with full weight range
}
```

**Typography Hierarchy:**
- `.title`: 1.5rem, weight 700
- `.subtitle`: 1.25rem, weight 700, blue accent
- `.small`: 0.875rem
- `.tiny`: 0.75rem
- Line-height strategy: headers (1), body text (1.5)

**Color System:**
- Dark theme with purple gradient background
- CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Glassmorphism card effects

## Implementation Details

### Key Discoveries

1. **Font Strategy**: dev-dil's Lexend variable font (100-900 weights) is superior to bg1's 8-file TestSöhne setup
2. **Design Token Quality**: bg1's spacing system (xxxs-xxxl) is more comprehensive than dev-dil's basic setup
3. **Component Architecture**: bg1's typography components are more sophisticated with mono support
4. **Theme Integration**: Both projects have different but valuable theming approaches

### Migration Approach

**Font Choice**: Use dev-dil's Lexend variable font implementation as the foundation
**Typography Components**: Adapt bg1's component hierarchy to use Lexend instead of TestSöhne
**Design Tokens**: Merge bg1's spacing system with dev-dil's color approach
**Architecture**: Maintain bg1's component API but simplify font loading

---

## Key Decisions

1. **Lexend Over TestSöhne**: User preference + dev-dil's proven implementation
2. **Variable Font Advantage**: Single file vs 8 separate TestSöhne files = better performance
3. **Preserve Component API**: Keep bg1's `mono` prop pattern for consistency
4. **Merge Token Systems**: Combine bg1's spacing with dev-dil's color tokens
5. **Gradual Migration**: Start with core typography, then expand to full design system

---

## Learnings & Notes

### For Future Agents:

1. **Font Loading Patterns**: Expo's `useFonts` vs CSS `@font-face` - both viable, choose based on platform needs
2. **Variable Fonts**: Modern approach reduces bundle size and provides more design flexibility
3. **Typography Hierarchy**: Semantic component naming (Title, Heading, Text) better than size-based (H1, H2, H3)
4. **Mono Support**: bg1's mono prop pattern is valuable for code/technical content
5. **Theme Integration**: Consider React Navigation theme compatibility for consistent styling

### Patterns That Worked:
- bg1's consistent component API
- dev-dil's CSS custom property organization
- Both projects' semantic naming conventions
- Variable font weight range utilization

### Things to Watch:
- Font loading performance on React Native
- Theme switching compatibility
- Cross-platform font rendering differences
- Bundle size impact of font assets

## Files Changed

**None yet** - This was an exploration phase to inform implementation decisions.

**Next Steps:**
1. Set up Lexend variable font in current braingame
2. Create typography component library adapted from bg1
3. Implement bg1's spacing token system
4. Test cross-platform compatibility

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Tasks:
1. Download and integrate Lexend variable font file
2. Create typography components based on bg1's hierarchy
3. Port bg1's spacing tokens to current design system
4. Set up theme integration for typography

### Architecture Decisions:
- Use Expo's font loading for React Native compatibility
- Maintain bg1's component API for easier migration
- Implement CSS custom properties for web platform
- Create unified theme system combining best of both projects

This exploration provides the foundation for a comprehensive typography migration that preserves the best elements from both legacy projects while modernizing the implementation.
