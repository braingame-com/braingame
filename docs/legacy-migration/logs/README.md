# Migration Logs

This folder contains detailed logs of each migration task completed during the legacy project consolidation.

## Log File Format

Each migration task should create a numbered log file following this pattern:
- `001-task-name.md`
- `002-next-task.md`
- etc.

## Required Log Sections

Each log file must include:

### **Task Summary**
- Brief description of what was migrated
- Source projects involved (bg1, dev-dil, or both)
- Target location in braingame

### **Source Analysis** 
- What was found in the legacy projects
- Key patterns or implementations discovered
- Assets identified for migration

### **Implementation Details**
- How the migration was executed
- Integration approach with current braingame architecture
- Any adaptations or modifications made

### **Key Decisions**
- Important choices made during the migration
- Rationale for specific approaches
- Trade-offs or compromises

### **Learnings & Notes**
- Insights for future agents
- Patterns that worked well
- Things to watch out for
- Recommendations for similar tasks

### **Files Changed**
- Complete list of files modified or created
- Brief description of changes per file

## Purpose

These logs serve to:
- Track migration progress
- Preserve decision rationale
- Help future agents understand the migration history
- Document learnings and patterns for reuse
- Provide audit trail for the consolidation effort

## Note

These migration logs are separate from the general work-session logs in `/docs/work-sessions/`. Migration logs focus specifically on the legacy consolidation project and should be created by agents working on migration tasks.
