## Phase 0: Setup and Restructuring

### Clean and Gut the Copied Package
**Date:** 15-07-2025 16:30  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `d281d6aff7fd9caf701d5249043ee4e768bc1857`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Inspected `packages/bgui/scripts/testModuleAugmentation.js` - MUI-specific module augmentation testing script
2. Deleted `packages/bgui/scripts/` directory using `rm -rf`
3. Deleted `packages/bgui/package.json.rn`
4. Deleted `packages/bgui/tsconfig.build.json`
5. Deleted `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
6. Replaced MUI's README.md with new BGUI placeholder README

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/scripts/testModuleAugmentation.js`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/scripts/` (entire directory)
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/package.json.rn`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.build.json`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
- Replaced: `packages/bgui/README.md` (was Joy UI readme, now BGUI placeholder)

**Challenges:**
- None encountered - straightforward cleanup task

**Notes:**
- The testModuleAugmentation.js script was specific to MUI's module augmentation patterns
- All deleted files were MUI-specific and not needed for the Platform Adapter Pattern
- New README includes migration status badges and links to documentation

**Next Task:**
- Adapt Web Component Tests

### Adapt Web Component Tests
**Date:** 15-07-2025 17:00  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `26677840de5e2aab6eeb53f7fe062c81445a53c9`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Investigated `packages/bgui/test` directory - contained only MUI-specific test helpers
2. Deleted entire `packages/bgui/test` directory as all tests were MUI-specific
3. Created new minimal `packages/bgui/jest.config.js` based on bgui_legacy pattern

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/test/` (entire directory including describeConformance.ts, integration tests, TypeScript tests)
- Created: `packages/bgui/jest.config.js`
- Updated: `docs/todo/BGUI_TODO.md` (marked task complete)

**Decisions Made:**
- Decided not to keep any MUI test files as they depend on @mui/internal-test-utils
- Will create new tests as components are built using Platform Adapter Pattern
- Used Jest to match bgui_legacy setup instead of Vitest

**Notes:**
- Tests will be written fresh for each component following the universal pattern
- Jest config is minimal and will be expanded as needed

**Next Task:**
- Integrate bgui into the Monorepo

### Integrate bgui into the Monorepo
**Date:** 15-07-2025 17:15  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `6741d545ae3065cf769482919100d16450ecf397`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created new `packages/bgui/package.json` matching monorepo structure
2. Changed name to `@braingame/bgui`
3. Added @mui dependencies needed for Joy UI source
4. Added @shopify/restyle for future native styling
5. Created `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json` extending root config
6. Ran `pnpm install` to install all dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- Replaced: `packages/bgui/package.json` (was MUI package.json)
- Created: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
- Updated: `docs/todo/BGUI_TODO.md` (marked task complete)

**Dependencies Added:**
- @mui/base@^5.0.0-beta.63
- @mui/system@^6.2.2
- @mui/types@^7.2.21
- @mui/utils@^6.2.2
- @shopify/restyle@^2.4.5
- clsx@^2.1.1
- prop-types@^15.8.1

**Notes:**
- CI pipeline already includes packages/* so no workflow updates needed
- Verified pnpm workspace includes all packages
- Fixed version constraints for @testing-library/jest-dom and @shopify/restyle

**Next Task:**
- Setup bgui Package Structure

### Setup bgui Package Structure
**Date:** 15-07-2025 18:00  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `25de390057ffd227545d2c5cf5ed786a65db1b4b`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created `packages/bgui/src/components` directory for future universal components
2. Created `packages/bgui/src/web-bgui` directory (renamed from web-joy for brand alignment)
3. Moved entire Joy UI source code from `src/` to `src/web-bgui/`
4. Created comprehensive `web-bgui/index.ts` exporting all Joy UI components
5. Fixed @mui/joy import in variantColorInheritance.tsx to use relative paths
6. Updated bgui_legacy package name to @braingame/bgui-legacy to avoid conflicts
7. Added skipLibCheck and allowJs to tsconfig.json for compatibility
8. Verified package builds successfully with `pnpm build`

**Files Modified:**
- Moved: 500+ files from `packages/bgui/src/` to `packages/bgui/src/web-bgui/`
- Created: `packages/bgui/src/web-bgui/index.ts`
- Created: `packages/bgui/src/components/` directory
- Updated: `packages/bgui/src/index.ts` (to export from web-bgui)
- Updated: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json` (added skipLibCheck, allowJs)
- Updated: `packages/bgui_legacy/package.json` (renamed to @braingame/bgui-legacy)
- Updated: `packages/bgui/src/web-bgui/styles/variantColorInheritance.tsx` (fixed import)

**Challenges:**
- Turbo build failed due to duplicate package name between bgui and bgui_legacy
- TypeScript errors due to @mui/joy imports in source files
- Build initially failed with missing @mui/joy/styles/types module

**Solutions:**
- Renamed bgui_legacy package to @braingame/bgui-legacy
- Fixed @mui/joy import to use relative path (./types)
- Added skipLibCheck to allow test files with @mui/joy imports to be excluded

**Notes:**
- Joy UI source is now properly isolated in web-bgui directory
- All components are exported via the new index.ts
- Build passes successfully, ready for next phase
- Test files still contain @mui/joy imports but are excluded from build

**Next Task:**
- Create Component Generator Script (Phase 0.5)

### Create Component Generator Script (Phase 0.5)
**Date:** 15-07-2025 18:30  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `0b6e1c98dd8e938332feb6ecb5511acfe2963ce3`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Reviewed existing `scripts/create-bgui-component.js` (was for old bgui_legacy pattern)
2. Completely rewrote script to follow Platform Adapter Pattern
3. Script now creates proper structure as specified in TODO:
   - ComponentName.native.tsx (Restyle implementation)
   - ComponentName.web.tsx (Joy UI re-export)
   - ComponentName.props.ts (shared interface)
   - ComponentName.test.tsx (test stub)
   - ComponentName.stories.tsx (Storybook stub)
   - index.ts (universal export)
4. Added automatic update of package exports in src/index.ts
5. Tested script with TestComponent, verified structure, then cleaned up
6. Made script executable with chmod +x

**Files Modified:**
- Replaced: `scripts/create-bgui-component.js` (complete rewrite)
- Updated: `docs/todo/BGUI_TODO.md` (marked task complete)

**Key Features:**
- Validates component name (must be PascalCase)
- Generates all required files with proper imports
- Web implementation imports from Joy UI as source of truth
- Native implementation includes TODOs for developer guidance
- Automatically updates package exports
- Provides helpful next steps after generation

**Notes:**
- Script emphasizes that Joy UI is the source of truth for visual design
- Native implementations should study the corresponding useComponent hooks
- Includes proper TypeScript types importing from web-bgui
- Ready for use in systematic component implementation phases

**Next Task:**
- Phase 0.75: Salvage bgui_legacy Assets
