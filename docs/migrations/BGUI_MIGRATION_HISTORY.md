## Phase 0: Setup and Restructuring

### Clean and Gut the Copied Package
**Date:** 15-07-2025 16:30  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `d281d6aff7fd9caf701d5249043ee4e768bc1857`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Inspected `packages/bgui/scripts/testModuleAugmentation.js` - MUI-specific module augmentation testing script
2. Deleted `packages/bgui/scripts/` directory using `rm -rf`
3. Deleted `packages/bgui/package.json.rn`
4. Deleted `packages/bgui/tsconfig.build.json`
5. Deleted `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
6. Replaced MUI's README.md with new BGUI placeholder README

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/scripts/testModuleAugmentation.js`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/scripts/` (entire directory)
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/package.json.rn`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.build.json`
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
- Replaced: `packages/bgui/README.md` (was Joy UI readme, now BGUI placeholder)

**Challenges:**
- None encountered - straightforward cleanup task

**Notes:**
- The testModuleAugmentation.js script was specific to MUI's module augmentation patterns
- All deleted files were MUI-specific and not needed for the Platform Adapter Pattern
- New README includes migration status badges and links to documentation

**Next Task:**
- Adapt Web Component Tests

### Adapt Web Component Tests
**Date:** 15-07-2025 17:00  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `26677840de5e2aab6eeb53f7fe062c81445a53c9`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Investigated `packages/bgui/test` directory - contained only MUI-specific test helpers
2. Deleted entire `packages/bgui/test` directory as all tests were MUI-specific
3. Created new minimal `packages/bgui/jest.config.js` based on bgui_legacy pattern

**Files Modified:**
- Deleted: `packages/bgui/test/` (entire directory including describeConformance.ts, integration tests, TypeScript tests)
- Created: `packages/bgui/jest.config.js`
- Updated: `docs/todo/BGUI_TODO.md` (marked task complete)

**Decisions Made:**
- Decided not to keep any MUI test files as they depend on @mui/internal-test-utils
- Will create new tests as components are built using Platform Adapter Pattern
- Used Jest to match bgui_legacy setup instead of Vitest

**Notes:**
- Tests will be written fresh for each component following the universal pattern
- Jest config is minimal and will be expanded as needed

**Next Task:**
- Integrate bgui into the Monorepo

### Integrate bgui into the Monorepo
**Date:** 15-07-2025 17:15  
**Engineer:** Claude (AI Agent)  
**Commit:** `6741d545ae3065cf769482919100d16450ecf397`

**Steps Taken:**
1. Created new `packages/bgui/package.json` matching monorepo structure
2. Changed name to `@braingame/bgui`
3. Added @mui dependencies needed for Joy UI source
4. Added @shopify/restyle for future native styling
5. Created `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json` extending root config
6. Ran `pnpm install` to install all dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- Replaced: `packages/bgui/package.json` (was MUI package.json)
- Created: `packages/bgui/tsconfig.json`
- Updated: `docs/todo/BGUI_TODO.md` (marked task complete)

**Dependencies Added:**
- @mui/base@^5.0.0-beta.63
- @mui/system@^6.2.2
- @mui/types@^7.2.21
- @mui/utils@^6.2.2
- @shopify/restyle@^2.4.5
- clsx@^2.1.1
- prop-types@^15.8.1

**Notes:**
- CI pipeline already includes packages/* so no workflow updates needed
- Verified pnpm workspace includes all packages
- Fixed version constraints for @testing-library/jest-dom and @shopify/restyle

**Next Task:**
- Setup bgui Package Structure
