# AGENTS.md - AI Agent Guidelines & Standards

> **Last Updated**: 23-06-2025

This document defines the roles, usage, and guard‚Äërails for **all AI agents, bots, or automations** that interact with the Brain Game monorepo.

## üìö **MANDATORY READING** (Before any development work)

> **Primary Directive:** All agents **MUST** read these docs before generating code, tests, or documentation:

### **Essential Workflow Docs:**
1. **[üìã CLAUDE.md](../ai/CLAUDE.md)** - Tactical guide with golden path workflow and commands
2. **[üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE.md](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - System design, worktree isolation, and technical blueprint
3. **[üìñ LESSONS.md](../architecture/LESSONS.md)** - Critical technical learnings, incident prevention, and session summaries
4. **[üìã CONTRIBUTING.md](../../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)** - Zero-tolerance quality standards and workflow

### **Critical Process Docs:**
- **[üîÑ PR_REVIEW_PROCESS.md](../engineering/PR_REVIEW_PROCESS.md)** - PR merge procedures with quality validation
- **[‚öôÔ∏è WORKTREES.md](../engineering/WORKTREES.md)** - Workspace isolation guide (prevents contamination)
- **[üìù TODO.md](../project/TODO.md)** - Current task tracker and priority management

### **Quality Standards:**
- **[üìä QUALITY.md](../architecture/QUALITY.md)** - Comprehensive code quality playbook with examples
- **[üíÖ CODING_STYLE.md](../engineering/CODING_STYLE.md)** - Code standards and anti-patterns
- **[üß™ TESTING.md](../engineering/TESTING.md)** - Testing strategy and hybrid approach

## Agent Roles

| Role | Scope | Example Tooling |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Development Assistant** | Code generation, refactoring, dependency upgrades | GitHub Copilot, Cursor, bespoke scripts |
| **Testing Agent** | Generate & run unit/e2e tests, report coverage | Jest, Playwright, Maestro |
| **CI/CD Bot** | Build, lint, test, deploy, publish packages | GitHub Actions, Changesets |
| **In‚ÄëApp Agents** | End‚Äëuser features (e.g. adaptive coaching) | OpenAI SDKs, Firebase Functions |

## Core Principles & Guardrails

### Quality Standards (ZERO TOLERANCE)
**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** All agents must adhere to our zero-tolerance quality policy.

**For complete quality standards, see: [üìã CONTRIBUTING.md](../.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)**

**Mandatory Quality Checks:**
- ‚ùå No lint errors or warnings (`pnpm lint` must be 0/0)
- ‚ùå No TypeScript errors (`pnpm typecheck` must be 0 errors)
- ‚ùå No `--no-verify` (bypassing pre-commit hooks is banned)
- ‚ùå No `any` types in public APIs
- ‚ùå No `@ts-expect-error` or `biome-ignore` without proper justification
- ‚ùå No technical debt introduction

**Before every commit:**
```bash
pnpm lint      # Must pass with 0 errors, 0 warnings
pnpm typecheck # Must pass with 0 errors
```

**Before every PR merge:**
```bash
# Checkout the PR branch first
gh pr checkout <number>

# Run quality validation
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build

# Only merge if all checks pass
gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** Follow [PR_REVIEW_PROCESS.md](./PR_REVIEW_PROCESS.md) exactly. Skipping quality validation on branches is the primary cause of technical debt on main.

### Operational Guardrails
- **Workspace Isolation:** Always verify which git worktree you're working in. Production work happens in the main `braingame/` directory, experimental/AI work happens in `braingame-claude-sandbox/`. When in doubt, ask.
  ```bash
  # MANDATORY at session start:
  git worktree list
  pwd && git branch --show-current
  ```
  ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Working in wrong directory has caused major incidents. See [LESSONS.md](../architecture/LESSONS.md#workspace-contamination-20-06-2025).
- **Human Review is Mandatory:** All agent-generated code must be reviewed and approved by a human maintainer before merging.
- **Read-Only by Default:** Agents should operate with the minimum necessary permissions. Write access is a privilege, gated by CI checks.
- **Secure by Design:** Credentials and secrets must be stored in the CI provider's secret manager, never in the repository.
- **Log Everything:** All significant agent actions must be logged and auditable, with anomalies surfaced in CI summaries.
- **Respect Ownership:** Agents must adhere to `CODEOWNERS` and branch protection rules.
- **Pinned Dependencies:** All agent-related tooling and dependencies should be pinned to specific versions to ensure stability. Upgrades must go through a PR.
- **Use Correct Dates:** All dates in documentation **MUST** follow the `DD-MM-YYYY` format and reflect the correct current date. Chronological accuracy is non-negotiable.
- **PR Verification:** A successful rebase + push ‚â† a successful merge. Always verify PR status explicitly:
  ```bash
  gh pr view <number> --json state,mergedAt,mergedBy
  ```

---

## Session Documentation Requirements

All AI agents must document their work sessions:

1. **Session Start:** Read [TODO.md](../project/TODO.md) and mark tasks as `in_progress`
2. **Session End:** 
   - Update [TODO.md](../project/TODO.md) with completion status
   - Add significant learnings to [LESSONS.md](../architecture/LESSONS.md)
   - Document any incidents or workarounds discovered
3. **Quality Checks:** Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm test` before marking tasks complete

---

## Adding a New Agent

1. **Document:** Add the agent's purpose, scope, and configuration to this file.
2. **Secure:** Create a secrets entry in the CI provider if needed.
3. **Comply:** Ensure the agent's output conforms to the project's Biome and style conventions.
4. **Propose:** Open a PR and tag `@maintainers` for review and approval.
