## Valid Concerns Requiring Action

### üî¥ Security (Critical)
- [PR] **NoSQL injection vulnerability** - Unsanitized API inputs (CVSS 7.5) - PR #202
- [PR] **Insecure session cookies** - Missing HttpOnly/Secure flags - PR #203
- [PR] **Stack traces exposed** in production responses - PR #204
- [PR] **Runtime logs committed to repo** - Privacy/security concern (6 Expo logs in apps/product) - PR #205
- [ ] **No encryption for PII** at rest or in backups

### üü° Launch Blockers (High Priority)
- [ ] **Payment processing only simulated** - No real payment integration
- [ ] **Signup flow incomplete** - Missing error states and validation
- [ ] **Empty state messaging absent** - Poor UX when no data
- [ ] **Navigation using stub implementation** - Will break with real features
- [ ] **Error reporting disabled** - Sentry/Crashlytics commented out
- [ ] **Analytics providers commented out** - No usage tracking

### üü† Compliance & Data (High Priority)
- [ ] **No GDPR/CCPA deletion workflows** - Legal requirement
- [ ] **Missing data lineage tracking** - Can't trace data flow
- [ ] **Weak backup and retention policies** - No DR strategy
- [ ] **No automated right-to-forget mechanism**

### üü¢ Developer Experience (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Node version mismatches** cause setup failures
- [ ] **Unit tests fail** due to ESM/React Native config issues
- [ ] **Lint/typecheck tools fail offline** - Network dependency
- [ ] **README has incorrect examples** - Package filter commands wrong
- [ ] **Missing integration and E2E tests**
- [ ] **PR template references npm** instead of pnpm

### üîµ Performance & Infrastructure (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **No staging/canary deployments** - Risky releases
- [ ] **Missing rollback procedures** and incident runbooks
- [ ] **Minimal observability** - Only basic Sentry setup
- [ ] **No feature flag system** - Can't toggle features
- [ ] **Build blocked by font downloads** - Slows CI/CD
- [ ] **CPU overprovisioned** - 96% idle, wasting money

### üü£ Design & Accessibility (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Low color contrast** on tasks page (4.02:1 vs 4.5:1 required)
- [ ] **Missing prefers-reduced-motion** handling
- [ ] **TextInput lacks ARIA labels** for screen readers
- [ ] **Limited localization** - Only English/Spanish, no RTL
- [ ] **Marketing site hardcodes values** instead of using design tokens
- [ ] **3 of 28 components missing** Storybook stories

### üü§ Mobile Platform Parity (Low Priority)
- [ ] **Android tab bar misaligned**

## Already Addressed or Disputed Items

### ‚úÖ Architecture & Documentation
- **"Solid monorepo architecture"** - Already well-structured
- **"Good documentation"** - Consultants noted this as positive
- **API latency ~20ms** - Performance is already good
- **90% test coverage goal** - Aspirational, not a requirement

### ‚ùå Disputed Recommendations
- **"Switch from Vitest to Jest"** - Vitest is modern choice, just needs config fix
- **"Consider serverless"** - Current infrastructure works well
- **"Trim marketing content"** - Content team disagrees
- **"Create growth dashboards"** - Premature optimization

### üö´ Not Applicable
- **"Docker containers run as root"** - Project doesn't use Docker
- **"S3 buckets have public-read ACLs"** - Project uses Firebase Storage, not AWS S3

### üîÑ In Progress (Per Current Branch)
- **Technical debt evaluation** - Current branch already addressing
- **OSS contribution friction** - Minor issues, not blocking

## Top 5 Immediate Actions

1. **Fix security vulnerabilities** - NoSQL injection, cookies, S3 buckets
2. **Complete payment integration** - Real processing for launch
3. **Enable error reporting** - Uncomment Sentry/Crashlytics
4. **Implement GDPR compliance** - Deletion workflows required by law
5. **Fix developer setup** - Node versions, test configs, documentation

---

## Decision Required

**Launch Readiness Score: 6/10**

Critical blockers exist in security, payments, and compliance. Recommend addressing "Critical" and "High Priority" items before launch.

## Implementation Notes

### Questions for Human Review
- Payment integration: Which provider to use? (Stripe, Square, etc.)
- S3 buckets: Which specific buckets need securing?
- PII encryption: What data specifically needs encryption?
- GDPR workflows: Legal requirements needed for implementation
