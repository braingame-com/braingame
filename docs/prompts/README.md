# 🎯 Engineering Excellence Prompts

This directory contains a curated set of AI prompts designed to elevate the engineering quality of this project through audits, reviews, and expert analysis.

## 🚀 Purpose

Use these prompts to:
- 🔍 Uncover blind spots in architecture, implementation, and tooling
- 🔒 Identify and patch security vulnerabilities early
- 📐 Make high-leverage architectural and technical decisions
- 📈 Continuously raise code quality and maintainability
- 🧠 Align the codebase with best-in-class engineering practices

## 📋 How to Use

1. Open `review_prompts.txt` and select a prompt relevant to your focus (e.g. architecture, performance, security)
2. Run the prompt with an advanced AI agent (e.g. Claude, GPT-4, Cursor, etc.)
3. The agent will generate a detailed report or review
4. Save the output in `prompts/output` using a filename like:  
   `architecture_audit.<UUID>.md`
5. Extract actionable items into `TODO.md` or your issue tracker
