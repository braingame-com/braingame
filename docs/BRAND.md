## 1. Core Principles

Our brand is built on **authority, clarity, and momentum.**

- **Authoritative, Not Arrogant:** We are experts, and our voice reflects that confidence. We state facts directly and avoid hedging language.
- **Clear, Not Clever:** We prioritize understanding above all. We use simple words and active voice. We avoid jargon and overly clever marketing-speak.
- **Momentum, Not Stagnation:** Our brand feels dynamic and forward-moving. The language is energetic and focused on action and results.

## 2. Voice & Tone

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Be direct and concise. | ❌ Don't use weak or passive language ("maybe," "perhaps"). |
| ✅ Use the active voice ("Build your focus," not "Focus can be built"). | ❌ Don't use buzzwords or corporate jargon. |
| ✅ Use "we" to refer to Brain Game, "you" to refer to the user. | ❌ Don't be overly formal or robotic. |
| ✅ Make bold, confident statements. | ❌ Don't apologize for our expert opinions. |
