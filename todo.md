# BGUI Component Quality Improvement Plan

## Overview
Systematic improvement of all BGUI components to ensure premium quality standards.

## Phase 1: Fix TypeScript Issues âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Replace all 'any' types with proper types (found in Accordion.tsx and List.tsx)
- [x] Add missing error prop types across components
- [x] Standardize prop naming conventions (Switch now uses 'checked' like Checkbox)
- [x] Ensure all components have proper TypeScript definitions

## Phase 2: Enhance Accessibility
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation to Image, Card, Divider components
- [ ] Complete ARIA attributes for all components
- [ ] Fix focus management (especially in Accordion)
- [ ] Add proper role attributes
- [ ] Ensure all interactive components are keyboard accessible

## Phase 3: Add Error Handling
- [ ] Implement React error boundaries for all components
- [ ] Add prop validation
- [ ] Create error states for Select, Accordion, and other components
- [ ] Add graceful fallbacks for edge cases

## Phase 4: Optimize Performance
- [ ] Wrap components in React.memo where beneficial
- [ ] Add useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations
- [ ] Optimize RadioGroup and Select re-renders
- [ ] Review and optimize event handlers

## Phase 5: Create Comprehensive Tests
- [ ] Add test files for all 22 components missing tests
- [ ] Include edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Ensure minimum 80% coverage
- [ ] Add integration tests for complex components

## Phase 6: Add Documentation
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all components
- [ ] Include prop descriptions in TypeScript types
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document component behavior and edge cases

## Phase 7: Refactor Code Organization
- [ ] Standardize file structure across all components
- [ ] Separate concerns (styling, logic, types)
- [ ] Standardize exports (prefer named exports)
- [ ] Create consistent component patterns

## Phase 8: Fix Styling Issues
- [ ] Replace hardcoded values with theme tokens
- [ ] Ensure consistent spacing using Tokens system
- [ ] Add responsive design considerations
- [ ] Implement consistent hover/focus states

## Phase 9: Implement Best Practices
- [ ] Clarify controlled/uncontrolled patterns
- [ ] Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- [ ] Improve component composition patterns
- [ ] Add proper default props and prop spreading

## Process for each phase:
1. Update this file to mark current phase as in progress
2. Make the improvements across all affected components
3. Run lint, tests, and TypeScript compilation
4. Update agents_context.md with what was done
5. Update this file to mark phase complete
6. Create a conventional commit
